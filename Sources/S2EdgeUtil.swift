/**
* A wedge relation's test method accepts two edge chains A=(a0,a1,a2) and
* B=(b0,b1,b2) where a1==b1, and returns either -1, 0, or 1 to indicate the
* relationship between the region to the left of A and the region to the left
* of B. Wedge relations are used to determine the local relationship between
* two polygons that share a common vertex.
*
*  All wedge relations require that a0 != a2 and b0 != b2. Other degenerate
* cases (such as a0 == b2) are handled as expected. The parameter "ab1"
* denotes the common vertex a1 == b1.
