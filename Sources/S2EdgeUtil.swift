		(about 1.11e-16) times the magnitude of the result. It is possible to
		analyze the calculation done by getIntersection() and work out the
		worst-case rounding error. I have done a rough version of this, and my
		estimate is that the worst case distance from the intersection point X to
		the great circle through (a0, a1) is about 12 ULPS, or about 1.3e-15. This
		needs to be increased by a factor of (1/0.866) to account for the
		edgeSpliceFraction() in S2PolygonBuilder. Note that the maximum error
		measured by the unittest in 1,000,000 trials is less than 3e-16.
