/**
	An S2Loop represents a simple spherical polygon. It consists of a single
	chain of vertices where the first vertex is implicitly connected to the last.
	All loops are defined to have a CCW orientation, i.e. the interior of the
	polygon is on the left side of the edges. This implies that a clockwise loop
	enclosing a small area is interpreted to be a CCW loop enclosing a very large area.

	Loops are not allowed to have any duplicate vertices (whether adjacent or
	not), and non-adjacent edges are not allowed to intersect. Loops must have at
	least 3 vertices. Although these restrictions are not enforced in optimized
	code, you may get unexpected results if they are violated.

	Point containment is defined such that if the sphere is subdivided into
	faces (loops), every point is contained by exactly one face. This implies
	that loops do not necessarily contain all (or any) of their vertices An
	S2LatLngRect represents a latitude-longitude rectangle. It is capable of
	representing the empty and full rectangles as well as single points.
